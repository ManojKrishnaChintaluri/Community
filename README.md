Obsrv comprises of several components that come together to enable the ability to measure and observe various actions and activities carried out by the system/ users. Obsrv can be utilised as an independent building block that allows for measurement, or as part of a system that employs different Sunbird blocks to enable  various workflows. It offers powerful data processing and aggregation infrastructure to process telemetry data generated by users & systems, validate the data, as well as aggregate and generate insights. It also has built-in open data cataloging and publishing capability. It is built keeping extensibility in mind, so that adopters have the flexibility to adapt the telemetry and tools to their specific use-cases.
